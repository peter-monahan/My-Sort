# Purpose
A sorting algorithm, that takes in an array of numbers, and is able to sort them with best case O(n) time complexity.

### More Info
When I first began learning about sorting algorithms, I was fascinated by the concept and decided to write my own. At that time, I believed that quicksort was the fastest algorithm overall. However, to my surprise, my sorting algorithm had a better average time complexity and was faster than quicksort for larger arrays.

Upon further research, I discovered that I had unintentionally developed an integer sort, which can outperform general-purpose sorts like quicksort. This experience taught me a great deal and inspired me to continue refining my algorithm in the future.
